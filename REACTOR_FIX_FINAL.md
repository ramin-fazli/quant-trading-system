ReactorNotRestartable Fix - FINAL IMPLEMENTATION
==============================================

PROBLEM ANALYSIS:
----------------
From the logs, the issue was:
1. Data pre-fetching called `reactor.run()` (traditional mode)
2. Reactor completed and stopped
3. Live trading tried to start reactor again ‚Üí ReactorNotRestartable error

The problem was that `reactor.running` was `False` during data pre-fetching,
so the system didn't know it was in a live trading context.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------

### 1. Enhanced Live Trading Context Detection

**File: `data/ctrader.py`**

Added `_detect_live_trading_context()` method that checks:

‚úÖ **Environment Variables:**
- `TRADING_MODE=live` set by main.py

‚úÖ **Call Stack Analysis:**
- Function names: `start_ctrader_trading`, `_prepare_trading_data`, etc.
- File patterns: `main.py` with trading functions
- Variable patterns: `mode='live'`, `execution_mode='live'`

‚úÖ **Multiple Detection Points:**
- Before reactor starts
- During data fetching initialization
- From any point in the call chain

### 2. Reactor Preservation Strategy

**Enhanced Mode Selection Logic:**
```python
if reactor.running:
    # Use async mode (reactor already running)
elif is_live_trading_context:
    # Use reactor-preserving mode (preparing for live trading)
else:
    # Use traditional mode (standalone operation)
```

**Reactor-Preserving Mode:**
- Skips `reactor.run()` completely
- Returns empty data for symbols
- Allows live trading to populate data real-time
- Preserves reactor for live trading broker

### 3. Environment Variable Setting

**File: `scripts/pair_trading/main.py`**

Added in `start_real_time_trading()`:
```python
os.environ['TRADING_MODE'] = 'live'
```

This ensures context detection works before any data fetching begins.

### 4. Fallback Strategy

When reactor is preserved:
- Data pre-fetching returns empty series
- Live trading starts with clean reactor
- Real-time data accumulates during trading
- No historical data loss (still stored in InfluxDB)

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
------------------

### Before Fix:
```
1. start_real_time_trading()
2. _prepare_trading_data()
3. CTrader data fetching: reactor.run() ‚Üê CLAIMS REACTOR
4. Data fetching completes, reactor stops
5. Live trading: reactor.run() ‚Üê FAILS: ReactorNotRestartable
```

### After Fix:
```
1. start_real_time_trading()
2. os.environ['TRADING_MODE'] = 'live' ‚Üê CONTEXT MARKER
3. _prepare_trading_data()
4. CTrader detects live context ‚Üê PRESERVES REACTOR
5. Returns empty data (skips reactor.run())
6. Live trading: reactor.run() ‚Üê SUCCESS: Clean reactor
```

TESTING READINESS:
------------------

The fix is ready for testing. Expected log messages:

‚úÖ **Context Detection:**
```
"üîß Set TRADING_MODE=live to help prevent reactor conflicts"
"Live trading context detected via TRADING_MODE environment variable"
```

‚úÖ **Reactor Preservation:**
```
"Live trading context detected - using async data fetching to preserve reactor for live trading"
"Reactor not running yet - using non-reactor data fetching to preserve reactor for live trading"
"Data pre-fetching skipped to preserve reactor for live trading"
```

‚úÖ **Successful Live Trading Start:**
```
"Starting cTrader Twisted reactor..."
[NO ReactorNotRestartable error]
```

DEPLOYMENT COMMAND:
-------------------
```bash
python scripts/pair_trading/main.py --mode live
```

MONITORING POINTS:
------------------

1. **Check for Context Detection:**
   - Look for "Live trading context detected" messages
   - Verify TRADING_MODE=live is set

2. **Verify Reactor Preservation:**
   - Look for "preserve reactor" messages
   - No "traditional data fetching" in live mode

3. **Confirm Successful Start:**
   - No ReactorNotRestartable error
   - Live trading proceeds normally

4. **Data Handling:**
   - Empty pre-fetch data is expected
   - Real-time data accumulation should work
   - InfluxDB still contains historical data

ROLLBACK STRATEGY:
------------------

If issues occur, the fix can be reverted by:
1. Removing environment variable setting in main.py
2. Reverting `_detect_live_trading_context()` method
3. Restoring original mode selection logic

The fix is minimal and targeted - it only affects the mode selection
during data pre-fetching for live trading scenarios.

FINAL STATUS: READY FOR LIVE TESTING ‚úÖ
